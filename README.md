<h1>LttR</h1>

Here is a short script that lets you listen to one of a few streaming radio stations from the command line. Is it a configuration file? No. Is it an excuse to make a pull request? Yes.

Submit a pull request to have your favorite station considered for inclusion.

To use:
```
$ curl -o lttr.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llamakc/LttR/master/listen-to-the-radio.sh 
$ chmod +x & ./lttr.sh
```

Anyway, thanks for all the fish.

**TO DO LIST**

- [ ] Change the name of the file to lttr.sh
