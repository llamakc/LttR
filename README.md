# Configuration Files

A collection of my favorite config files, uploaded to github both because I'm happy to share them with the world, and also because I always lose them 
on a re-install and now they're all saved in one place.

Also included is a short script that lets you listen to one of a few streaming radio stations from the Command Line. Is it a configuration file? No. Is it an excuse to make a pull request? Yes.
