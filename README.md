Here is a short script that lets you listen to one of a few streaming radio stations from the command line. Is it a configuration file? No. Is it an excuse to make a pull request? Yes.

Submit a pull request to have your favorite station considered for inclusion.

Anyway, thanks for all the fish.

**ECCE HOMO!!!**

This script depends on mplayer. Install using your distro's preferred package management system.
